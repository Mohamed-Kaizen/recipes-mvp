## Using Fetch to Consume APIs with Svelte

Working with external data in Svelte is important. Here's a guide.

*Maintainers of this Recipe: [swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx)*

### Fetching on Component Mount in Svelte

**Method 1: Using Lifecycles**

We can declare a `data` variable and use the `onMount` lifecycle to fetch on mount and display data in our component:

```html
<!-- https://svelte.dev/repl/99c18a89f05d4682baa83cb673135f05?version=3.20.1 -->
<script>
  import { onMount } from 'svelte'
  let data
  onMount(async () => {
	data = await fetch('https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json').then(x => x.json())
  })
</script>

<pre>
  {JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}
</pre>
```

You can further improve this implementation by showing a placeholder while `data` is undefined and also showing an error notification if an error occurs.

**Method 2: Using Await Blocks**

Since it is very common to update your app based on the status of your data fetching, Svelte offers convenient [await blocks](https://svelte.dev/docs#await) to help.

This example is exactly equal to Method 1 above:

```html
<!-- https://svelte.dev/repl/977486a651a34eb5bd9167f989ae3e71?version=3.20.1 -->
<script>
let promise = fetch('https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json')
	.then(x => x.json())
</script>

{#await promise}
	<!-- optionally show something while promise is pending -->
{:then data}
	<!-- promise was fulfilled -->
	<pre>
		{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}
	</pre>
{:catch error}
	<!-- optionally show something while promise was rejected -->
{/await}
```

Here you can see that it is very intuitive where to place your loading placeholder and error display.

### Fetching on Button Click in Svelte

One flaw with the above approach is that it does not offer a way for the user to refetch data, and additionally we may not want to render on mount (for data saving or UX reasons).

**Method 1: Simple Click Handler**

If we don't want to immediately load data on component mount, we can wait for user interaction instead:

```html
<!-- https://svelte.dev/repl/2a8db7627c4744008203ecf12806eb1f?version=3.20.1 -->
<script>
  let data
  const handleClick = async () => {
    data = await fetch('https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json')
	.then(x => x.json())
  }
</script>

<button on:click={handleClick}>
  Click to Load Data
</button>
<pre>
  {JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}
</pre>
```

The user now has an intuitive way to refresh their data.

However, there are some problems with this approach. You may still need to declare an extra variable to display error state. More subtly, when the user clicks for a refresh, the stale data still displays on screen, if you are not careful.

**Method 2: Await Blocks**

It would be better to make all this commonplace UI idioms declarative. Await blocks to the rescue again:

```html
<!-- https://svelte.dev/repl/98ec1a9a45af4d75ac5bbcb1b5bcb160?version=3.20.1 -->
<script>
  let promise
  const handleClick = () => {
	promise = fetch('https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json')
		.then(x => x.json())
  }
</script>

<button on:click={handleClick}>
  Click to Load Data
</button>

{#await promise}
  <!-- optionally show something while promise is pending -->
{:then data}
  <!-- promise was fulfilled -->
  <pre>
    {JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}
  </pre>
{:catch error}
  <!-- optionally show something while promise was rejected -->
{/await}
```

The trick here is we can simply reassign the `promise` to trigger a refetch, which then also clears the UI of stale data while fetching.

**Method 3: Promise Swapping**

Of course, it is up to you what UX you want - you may wish to keep displaying stale data and merely display a loading indicator instead while fetching the new data. Here's a possible solution using a second promise to execute the data fetching while the main promise stays onscreen:

```html
<!-- https://svelte.dev/repl/21e932515ab24a6fb7ab6d411cce2799?version=3.20.1 -->
<script>
  let promise1, promise2
  const handleClick = () => {
 	promise2 = new Promise(res => setTimeout(() => res(Math.random()), 1000)).then(x=> {promise1 = promise2; return x})
  }
</script>

<button on:click={handleClick}>
  Click to Load Data {#await promise2}ðŸŒ€{/await}
</button>

{#await promise1}
  <!-- optionally show something while promise is pending -->
{:then value}
  <!-- promise was fulfilled -->
  <pre>
    {value}
  </pre>
{:catch error}
  <!-- optionally show something while promise was rejected -->
{/await}
```

### Dealing with CORS Errors in Svelte

Svelte is purely a frontend framework, so it will be subject to the same CORS restrictions that any frontend framework faces. You will run into CORS issues in two ways:

1. In local development (making requests from `http://localhost` to `https://myapi.com`)
2. In production (making requests from `https://mydomain.com` to `https://theirapi.com`)

You can solve both with a range of solutions from having a local API dev server or proxying requests through a serverless function or API gateway. None are responsibilities of Svelte but here are some helpful resources that may help:

- https://alligator.io/nodejs/solve-cors-once-and-for-all-netlify-dev/
- https://zeit.co/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction
- https://docs.begin.com/en/http-functions/api-reference
- https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/amplify-framework-local-mocking/

If you happen to be running [a Sapper app](https://sapper.svelte.dev/), then you may take advantage of preloading data server-side in Sapper: https://sapper.svelte.dev/docs#Preloading.

You now have all you need to work with Data APIs in Svelte.

## Reactivity

### Reactive assignments

The reactivity system introduced in Svelte 3 has made it easier than ever to trigger updates to the DOM. Despite this, there are a few simple rules that you must always follow. This guide explains how Svelte's reactivity system works, what you can and can't do, as well a few pitfalls to avoid.

#### Top-level variables

The simplest way to make your Svelte components reactive is by using an assignment operator. Any time Svelte sees an assignment to a *top-level variable* an update is scheduled. A 'top-level variable' is any variable that is defined inside the script element but is not a child of *anything*, meaning, it is not inside a function or a block. Incidentally, these are also the only variables that you can reference in the DOM. Let's look at some examples.

The following works as expected and update the dom:

```sv
<script>
  let num = 0;

  function updateNum() {
    num = 25;
  }
</script>

<button on:click={updateNum}>Update</button>
<p>{num}</p>
```

Svelte can see that there is an assignment to a top-level variable and knows to rerender after the `num` variable is modified.

#### `each` blocks

The only exception to the top-level variable rule is when you are inside an `each` block. Any assignments to variables inside an `each` block trigger an update. Only assignments to array items that are objects or arrays result in the array itself updating. If the array items are primitives, the change is not traced back to the original array. This is because Svelte only reassigns the actual array items and primitives are passed by value in javascript, not by reference.

The following example causes the array and, subsequently, the DOM to be updated:

```sv
<script>
  let list = [{ n: 1 }, { n: 2 }, { n: 3 }];
</script>

{#each list as item}
  <button on:click={() => item.n *= 2 }>{ item.n }</button>
{/each}
```

This, however, will not:

```sv
<script>
  let list = [1, 2, 3];
</script>

{#each list as item}
  <button on:click={() => item *= 2 }>{ item.n }</button>
{/each}
```

#### Variables not values

Svelte only cares about which *variables* are being reassigned, not the values to which those variables refer. If the variable you reassign is not defined at the top level, Svelte does not trigger an update, even if the value you *are* updating updates the original variable's value as well.

This is the sort of problem you may run into when dealing with objects. Since objects are passed by reference and not value, you can refer to the same value in many different variables. Let's look at an example:

```sv
<script>
  let obj = {
    num: 0
  };

  function updateNum() {
    const o = obj;
    o.num = 25;
  }
</script>

<button on:click={updateNum}>Update</button>
<p>{obj.num}</p>
```

In this example, when we reassign `o.num` we are updating the value assigned to `obj` but since we are not updating the actual `obj` variable SVelte does not trigger an update. Svelte does not trace these kinds of values back to a variable defined at the top level and has no way of knowing if it has updated or not. Whenever you want to update the local component state, any reassignments must be performed on the *actual* variable, not just the value itself.

#### Shadowed variables

Another situation that can sometimes cause unexpected results is when you reassign a function's parameter (as above), and that parameter has the same *name* as a top-level variable.

```sv
<script>
  let obj = {
    num: 0
  };

  function(obj) {
    obj.num = 25;
  }
</script>

<button on:click={() => updateNum(obj)}>Update</button>
<p>{num}</p>
```

This example behaves the same as the previous example, except it is perhaps even more confusing. In this case, the `obj` variable is being *shadowed* while inside the function, so any assignments to `obj` inside this function are assignments to the function parameter rather than the top-level `obj` variable. It refers to the same value, and it has the same name, but it is a *different* variable inside the function scope.

Reassigning function parameters in this way is the same as reassigning a variable that points back to the top-level variable's value and does not cause an update. To avoid these problems, and potential confusion, it is a good idea not to reuse variable names in different scopes (such as inside functions), and always make sure that you are reassigning a top-level variable.


### Reactive Declarations

In addition to the assignment-based reactivity system, Svelte also has special syntax to define code that should rerun when its dependencies change using labeled statements - `$: `.

```sv
<script>
  let n = 0;

  $: n_squared = n * n;
</script>

<button on:click={() => n += 1}>{ n_squared }</button>
```

Whenever Svelte sees a reactive declaration, it makes sure to execute any reactive statements that depend on one another in the correct order and only when their direct dependencies have changed. A 'direct dependency' is a variable that is referenced inside the reactive declaration itself. References to variables inside functions that a reactive declaration *calls* are not considered dependencies.

```sv
<script>
  let n = 0;

  const squareIt = () => n * n;

  $: n_squared = squareIt();
</script>

<button on:click={() => n += 1}>{ n_squared }</button>
```

In the above example, `n_squared` will *not* be recalculated when `n` changes because Svelte is not looking inside the `squareIt` function to define the reactive declaration's dependencies.

#### Defining dependencies

Sometimes you want to rerun a reactive declaration when a value changes but the variable itself is not required (in the case of some side-effects). The solution to this involves listing the dependency inside the declaration in some way.

The simplest solution is to pass the variable as an argument to a function, even if that variable is not required.

```js
let my_value = 0;

function someFunc() {
  console.log(my_value);
}

$: someFunc(my_value);
```

In this example, `someFunc` doesn't require the `my_value` argument, but this lets Svelte know that `my_value` is a dependency of this reactive declaration and should rerun whenever it changes. In general, it makes sense to use any parameters that are passed in, even though all of these variables are in scope, it can make the code easier to follow.

```js
let my_value = 0;

function someFunc(value) {
  console.log(value);
}

$: someFunc(my_value);
```

Here we have refactored `someFunc` to take an argument, making the code easier to follow.

If you need to list multiple dependencies and passing them as arguments is not an option, then the following pattern can be used:

```js
let one;
let two;
let three;

const someFunc = () => sideEffect();

$: one, two, three, someFunc();
```

This simple expression informs Svelte that it should rerun whenever `one`, `two`, or `three` changes. This expression runs the line of code whenever these dependencies change.

Similarly, if you only want to rerun a function when a variable changes *and* is truthy then you can use the following pattern:

```js
let one;

const someFunc = () => sideEffect();

$: one && someFunc();
```

If the value of `one` is not truthy, then this short circuit expression stops at `one` and `someFunc` is not executed.

#### Variable deconstruction

Assigning a new value in a reactive declaration essentially turns these declarations into computed variables. However, deconstructing an object or array inside a reactive declaration may seem verbose or even impossible at first glance.

since `$: const { value } = object` is not valid javascript, we need to take a different approach. You can deconstruct values using reactive declarations by forcing javascript to interpret the statement as an expression.

To achieve this, all we need to do is wrap the declaration with parentheses:

```js
let some_obj = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 }

$: ({ one, two, three } = some_obj);
```

Javascript interprets this as an expression, deconstructing the value as expected with no unnecessary code required.

#### Hiding values from reactive declarations

On ocassion, you may wish to run a reactive declaration when only *some* of its dependencies change, in essence, you need to *hide* specific dependencies from Svelte. This is the opposite case of declaring additional dependencies and can be achieved by not referencing the dependencies in the reactive declaration but *hiding* those references in a function.

```js
let one;
let two;

const some_func = n => console.log(n * two);

$: some_func(one);
```

The reactive declaration in this example reruns *only* when `one` changes, we have hidden the reference to `two` inside a function because Svelte does not look inside of referenced functions to track dependencies.


## Stores

> _This guide assumes you understand the basics of Svelte Stores. If you aren't familiar with them then working through the [relevant tutorial](tutorial/writable-stores) and reading the [store documentation](docs#svelte_store) are highly recommended._

Svelte stores offer a simple mechanism to handle shared state in your Svelte application but looking beyond the built-in store implementations will unlock a whole world of power that you could never have dreamed of. In this episode of _The Tinest Kitchen_ we'll take a close look at [The Store Contract](#The_Store_Contract), learn how to implement [Custom Stores](#Custom_Stores), by making use of the built-in store API, and explore how we can implement [a completely custom store]() without using the built-in stores at all.

### The store contract

The built-in Svelte stores (`readable`, `writable`, and `derived`) are just store _implementations_ and while they are perfectly capable of handling many tasks, sometimes you need something more specific. Although often overlooked, the store _contract_ is what gives these stores their power and flexibility. Without this contract, svelte stores would be awkward to use and require significant amounts of boilerplate.

Svelte does not compile your javascript files and, as such, only observes the store contract inside Svelte components.

#### `store.subscribe`

At its simplest, the store contract is this: any time Svelte sees a variable prepended with `$` in a Svelte component (such as `$store`) it calls the `subscribe` method of that variable. The `subscribe` method must take a single argument, which is a function, and it must _return_ a function that allows any subscribers to unsubscribe when necessary. Whenever the callback function is called, it must be passed the current store value as an argument. The callback passed to subscribe should be called when subscribing and anytime the store value changes.

The following examples aren't the _exact_ code that Svelte produces, rather, simplified examples to illustrate the behaviour.

This:

```js
import { my_store } from './store.js';

console.log($my_store);
```

Becomes something like this:

```js
import { my_store } from './store.js';

let $my_store;
const unsubscribe = my_store.subscribe(value => ($my_store = value));
onDestroy(unsubscribe);

console.log($my_store);
```

The callback function passed to `my_store.subscribe` is called immediately and whenever the store value changes. Here, Svelte has automatically produced some code to assign the `my_store` value to `$my_store` whenever it is called. If  `$my_store` is referenced in the component, it also causes those parts of the component to update when the store value changes. When the component is destroyed, Svelte calls the unsubscribe function returned from `my_store.subscribe`.

#### `store.set`

Optionally, a store can have a `set` method. Whenever there is an assignment to a variable prepended with `$` in a Svelte component it calls the `set` method of that variable with newly mutated or reassigned `$variable` as an argument. Typically, this `set` argument should update the store value and call all subscribers, but this is not required. For example, Svelte's `tweened` and `spring` stores do not immediately update their values but rather schedule updates on every frame for as long as the animation lasts. If you decide to take this approach with `set`, we advise not [binding](tutorial/store-bindings) to these stores as the behaviour could be unpredictable.

This:

```js
$my_store = 'Hello';
```

Will become something like:

```js
$my_store = 'Hello';
my_store.set($my_store);
```

The same is true when assigning to a nested property of a store.

This:

```js
$my_store.greeting = 'Hello';
```

Becomes:

```js
$my_store.greeting = 'Hello';
my_store.set($my_store);
```

Although Svelte's built-in stores also have an `update` method, this is not part of the contract and is not required to benefit from the automatic subscriptions, unsubscriptions, and updates that the store contract provides. Stores can have as many additional methods as you like, allowing you to build powerful abstractions that take advantage of the automatic reactivity and cleanup that the store contract provides.

To summarise, the store contract states that svelte stores must be an object containing the following methods:

- `subscribe` - Automatically called whenever svelte sees a `$` prepended variable (like `$store`) ensuring that the `$` prepended value always has the current store value. Subscribe must accept a function which is called both immediately, and whenever the store value changes, it must return an unsubscribe function. The callback function must be passed the current store value as an argument whenever it is called.
- `set` - Automatically called whenever Svelte sees an assignment to a `$` prepended variable (like `$store = 'value'`). This should generally update the store value and call all subscribers.

### Custom stores

Now we know what Svelte needs to make use of the shorthand store syntax, we can get to work implementing a custom store by augmenting a svelte store and re-exporting it. Since Svelte doesn't care about additional methods being present on store objects, we are free to add whatever we like as long as `subscribe`, and optionally `set`, are present.

#### Linked stores

In this first example, we are creating a function that returns two linked stores that update when their partner changes, this example uses this linked store to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice-versa. The interface looks like this:

```js
store : { subscribe, set }
function(a_to_b_function, b_to_a_function): [store, store]
```

To implement this store, we need to create two writable stores, write custom `set` methods for each, and return an array of store objects containing this `set` method.

We define a function first as this implementation is a store _creator_ allowing us plenty of flexibility. The function needs to take two parameters, each being a callback function which is called when the stores are updated. The first function takes the first store value and returns a value that sets the value of the second store. The second argument does the opposite. One of these functions is called when the relevant `set` method is called.

```js
import { writable } from 'svelte/store';

function synced(a_to_b, b_to_a) {
	const a = writable();
	const b = writable();
}
```

The `set` methods call their own `set` with the provided value and call the partner store's `set` when the provided value is passed through the callback function.

```js
// called when store_a.set is called or its binding reruns
function a_set($a) {
	a.set($a);
	b.set(a_to_b($a));
}

// called when store_b.set is called or its binding reruns
function b_set($b) {
	b.set(b_to_a($b));
	a.set($b);
}
```

All we need to do now is return an array of objects each containing the correct `subscribe` and `set` method:

```js
return [
	{ subscribe: a.subscribe, set: a_set },
	{ subscribe: b.subscribe, set: b_set },
];
```

Inside a component, we can use this synced store creator by deconstructing the returned array. This ensures Svelte can subscribe to each store individually, as stores definitions need to be at the top level for this to happen. This store can be imported and reused in any component.

```js
import { synced } from './synced.js';

const [a, a_plus_five] = synced(
	a => a + 5,
	b => a - 5
);

$c = 0; // set an initial value
```

Since we have written custom `set` methods, we are also free to bind to each individual store. When one store updates, the other also updates after the provided function is applied to the value.

See it in action below. The following example uses the `synced` store to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit in both directions.

<div class="max">
  <iframe
    title="A Custom Synced Store"
    src="/repl/embed?example=cookbook-svelte-store-synced"
    scrolling="no"
  ></iframe>
</div>

*the stuff i actually wrote ends here, this is a fun example that could be included though*

### a custom implementation of the builtin store

A simple store is about 20 lines of code, in many cases the built-in stores provide good primitives you can build on but sometimes it makes sense to write your own.

The most basic implementation would look something like this ([REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl/1c055b975b6d42f5b8623bad5d92e8fc?version=3.14.0)) (this is simpler than the built-in stores):

```js
function writable(init) {
  let _val = init;
  const subs = [];

  const subscribe = cb => {
    subs.push(cb);
    cb(_val);

    return () => {
      const index = subs.findIndex(fn => fn === cb);
      subs.splice(index, 1);
    };
  };

  const set = v => {
    _val = v;
    subs.forEach(fn => fn(_val));
  };

  const update = fn => set(fn(_val));

  return { subscribe, set, update };
}
```

From this point you could add whatever functionality you wanted.

Edit: Probably worth mentioning that this is a full writable implementation, only the subscribe method and its return value (an unsubscribe function) are required to be a valid store.
